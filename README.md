# AirshipACE Unreal Edition

This is the Unreal 5 version of Airship ACE. I am working on getting an MVP where the player can select, fly, fight and complete a simple mission.

## Gameplay
The game is a 3d side-scrolling game where you as a captain of an airship must fly to a city carrying critical vaccines for the people. As you make you're way to the town you will have to fight off bandits who will attempt to shoot you down.
## Mechanics
Your airship is physics-based, and as you select your ship, cargo and weapons you must be mindful of how this will balance, buoyancy and fly even after taking damage.

The MVP will first be PC/MAC only at first, moving to be an iOS/iPadOS app as well.
